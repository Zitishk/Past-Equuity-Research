This repository showcases my work as an Equity Analyst in the **Robert H. Smith School of Business’ Mayer Fund**, a student-managed investment fund overseeing **$8.5M AUM**. I was one of twelve analysts selected to manage the fund, responsible for the **Consumer Staples sector**.

- Conducted **deep-dive equity research** and valuation modeling for:
    - **Hershey Co. (HSY)**
    - **Kimberly-Clark Corp. (KMB)**
    - **Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM)**
    - **Procter & Gamble Co. (PG)**
    
- Developed **comprehensive valuation models** (DCF and Comparable Multiples) in Excel.
    
- Authored **investment reports** detailing the thesis, catalysts, valuation, and risk analysis.
    
- Delivered **weekly market updates** for the Consumer Staples sector to the entire fund.
    
- Led **three strategic rebalancing cycles**, realigning sector weights based on macro trends and risk–reward outlooks in coordination with fixed annual rebalancing timelines.

### Conclusion

Managing the Consumer Staples portfolio within an actively run $8.5M fund sharpened my ability to form independent investment views, build robust valuation models, and communicate conviction in a high-accountability, real-capital setting—experience I’m eager to carry forward in a professional buy-side environment.
